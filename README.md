# eDenocracy
A prototype user inteface for discussion of current affairs online, which can be trialled here: The prototype can be trialled here: http://95.85.12.31/eDenocracy.html

This prototype was developed following interviews with social media users who identified a number of factors that prevent them participating in online disucssions.

Following the exploration of various design alternatives, an interactive deliberative tool - eDenocracy - was developed. eDenocracy provides a means of a discussion in which the arguments are represented as bubbles, that can be resized by the user in correspondence with their perceived importance. Early user evaluation of eDenocracy suggests that it could address the consideration of alternatives but retains challenges for overcoming self-censorship. This research is intended to trigger further investigation into the challenges of eDeliberation, and provide a starting point for future design work.
